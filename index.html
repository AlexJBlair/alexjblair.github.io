      <p class="about-description">
        I started coding in college when on a whim I decided to take computer
        science with my friend Trevor. Since then I have been in love with the
        software development process and all things tech. I strive to learn more
        and adapt to the ever changing world of technology. In my free time I
        play games and sometimes post videos on youtube. I also ski in the
        winter and love to watch baseball in the summer.

      <p class="cat-info">
        I have two cats. A tuxedo named Mittens,

        and a white and black tabby named Oliver.

      <p class="coffee-info">
        I also love all things coffee and I am currently attempting to learn how
        to make latte art. Here is an example of one of my first attempts ðŸ˜‚.

        />

      <p class="plans">

        things that interst me. Please feel free to poke around and see what
        projects I am currently working on.
