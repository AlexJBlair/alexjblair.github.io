Abour Me:
---------
I started coding in college when on a whim I decided to take computer science with my friend Trevor. Since then I have been in love with the software development process and all things tech. I strive to learn more and adapt to the ever changing world of technology. In my free time I play games and sometimes post videos on youtube. I also ski in the winter and love to watch baseball in the summer. I have two cats named Mittens ![Mittens Profile](/images/Mittens.JPG) who is a tuxedo cat, and Oliver ![Oliver Profile](/images/oliver.JPG), a white annd gray tabby. I also love all things coffee and I am currently attempting to learn latte art. ![bad latte art](/images/Latte.JPG)
